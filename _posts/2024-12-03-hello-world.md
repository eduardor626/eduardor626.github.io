# Why The Blog? 🤔

I've always been interested in creating a personal blog because it allows me to organize what I've learned and document my work.

## Inspiration 💭

I follow many personal blogs of people I've never met. I find value in their posts, I bookmark their blog pages so that I can continue to view what they're working on.

Specifically in the software engineering realm, I enjoy learning from other engineers to enhance my own knowledge of a certain topic.

### Documentation 🗎

Documenting my technical progress through these blog posts seems like a valuable investment of my time. This will also help me solidify what I've learned through explanation and organization!


### Educational Purpose 👨🏻‍🏫
If you truly know a certain topic, you can teach it well.

Through deliberate practice and continuous effort, I hope to explain complex topics in a clear and concise fashion.

 Documenting my findings, organizing my notes, and putting them into a well-structured format that makes sense is a great start to becoming a great teacher.

# What Do I Have To Blog About? 🤔

### Software Development 👨🏻‍💻
I'm passionate about expanding my technical skills, especially in programming. 

Organizing the new concepts, tools, and material that I learn through documentation is key to solidifying my knowledge and growing as a software engineer.


### Books 📚
I enjoy creating book reviews in order to review all the notes I've taken throughout the book and putting them together to form my own summary. 

This facilitates my overall understanding of the book and helps me formalize my own opinion of it. 

# And What If No One Cares? 🥲
I care! Haha ultimately, that's what matters most. Journaling is a huge stress reliever and I've always enjoyed organizing my thoughts/notes in a manner that makes sense to me.

Even if no one reads my material, I still get the chance to practice my vocabulary, presentation skills, and review what I've learned while documenting my journey.

Stay tuned ✌🏼
