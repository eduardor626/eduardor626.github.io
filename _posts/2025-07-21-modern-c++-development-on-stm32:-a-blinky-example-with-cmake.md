## Introduction

In this tutorial, I‚Äôll walk you through setting up the STMicroelectronics **STM32WB55RG** development board for **C++** development using a **CMake** build system and **VSCode** as the IDE of choice. We‚Äôll create a simple Blinky example (the embedded system‚Äôs classic üó£Ô∏è‚ÄúHello World") that toggles the blue LED on the `Nucleo-WB55RG` board.

While ST provides the **STM32CubeIDE** application for development, I prefer using **VSCode**.

Setting this up took some effort, so I‚Äôm documenting the process for others looking to build a modern C++ embedded development workflow.


## Board Overview: STM32WB55RG Key Features üóùÔ∏è

The **STM32WB55RG** is a powerful and versatile board featuring:

- Dual core Arm Cortex M4 processor with FPU (Floating Point Unit)
- Built in Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)
- Low power design for battery friendly applications
- Various peripherals: GPIO, timers, ADC, UART, SPI, I2C, and more

## Project Goals üéØ

![Alt text](/assets/2025/july/stm32/blink.png)

- Use **STM32CubeMX** to generate HAL code for gpio communication  
- Set up a **CMake based** project with C++ support in VSCode  
- Blink the onboard blue LED every 5 seconds  
- Create a flexible, modular structure for future C++ embedded development 

---

## Required Tools üõ†Ô∏è

- **STM32CubeMX**: Pin configuration and HAL generation  
- **STM32CubeProgrammer**: Flashing the final firmware  
- **VSCode**: Code development and build management  
- **GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain** (`arm-none-eabi-gcc`)

## Hardware Setup üìü

### MCU vs. Board Selector

![Alt text](/assets/2025/july/stm32/select.png)


Select **Board Selector** in STM32CubeMX when targeting ST development boards like the `Nucleo-WB55RG`. The **MCU Selector** is typically reserved for custom PCBs or bare STM32 chips. 

Once we've selected the `Nucleo-WB55RG` board, we are ready to start our project.


## Configuring the Output Pins üö•

To blink the blue LED, we first need to determine its GPIO pin assignment from the `Nucleo-WB55RG` schematic.

### Selecting the LED Pin
![Alt text](/assets/2025/july/stm32/schematic.png)

From the schematic, we see that the Blue LED is connected to **GPIO Port B, Pin 5 (PB5)**.  
In CubeMX, we can configure this pin as a **GPIO Output** using the pinout tool.

Now that we've configured our GPIO output pin for toggling our Blue LED, we can manage our project structure.

---

## Project Manager Configuration 

Select the **Project Manager** tab in CubeMX and:

- Name the project (e.g., `Blinky`)
- Choose **CMake** as the toolchain


![Alt text](/assets/2025/july/stm32/project.png)

Now that we've completed the code setup, we are ready to select **Generate Code**.


## Code Generation: STM32CubeMX Output

CubeMX generates:

- HAL drivers for the configured peripherals in the pintool step  
- Startup code and a linker script  
- A `CMakeLists.txt` and `CMakePresets.json` for building the final executable

You‚Äôll get a clean project structure like this:

```bash
$ tree -L 1
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Blinky.ioc
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CMakeLists.txt
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CMakePresets.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Core
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Drivers
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cmake
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ startup_stm32wb55xx_cm4.s
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ stm32wb55xx_flash_cm4.ld
```

All generated code is in C, which is fine, it allows for clean separation between CubeMx generated code and our higher level C++ logic.

- **Warning**: CubeIDE doesn't work nicely with custom Cmake or C++ structures and tends to overwrite `main.c` when we import the generated `.ioc` file from CubeMX. This was another reason I decided to use VSCode, to preserve the generated `main.c`. 

## A Hybrid Workflow: CubeMx + VSCode 

I've found that using a hybrid workflow helps in keeping the HAL generated code functionality while maintaining a flexible development environment.

Here's my hybrid workflow:

- Generate the base project using CubeMX with Cmake

- Open the project in VSCode, not CubeIDE

- Add C++ support in `CMakeLists.txt`

- Keep the CubeMX generated `main.c` minimal by redirecting to a C++ entry point

- Keep  C++ code (`.cpp/.hpp`) outside generated folders

- Regenerate from CubeMX safely, so HAL updates won‚Äôt touch our logic

This lets CubeMX handle low level configuration work, while we manage the application level with C++ abstractins.

## Adding C++ Support in CMake ü¶æ

We must edit the generated CMake file to enable C++17 support. We open the folder of the gnerated code using VSCode and update the `CMakeLists.txt`:

```cmake
# Enable C++17
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)

project(${CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME} LANGUAGES C CXX ASM)

enable_language(C CXX ASM)
```
Now our STM32 project can support C++ files like `app.cpp`.

## Redirecting the Entry Point ‚ñ∂Ô∏è
CubeMX will generate a `main.c` file that looks similar to the code snippet below. Generating initialization functions but allowing for the user to enter their own code in certain sections:

```c

int main(void)
{
  HAL_Init();
  SystemClock_Config();
  PeriphCommonClock_Config();
  MX_GPIO_Init(); // Initializes our configured GPIO pin

  /* USER CODE BEGIN */
  while (1)
  {

  }
  /* USER CODE END */

}
```

Rather than using this `while(1)` loop directly, we‚Äôll delegate control to a `start()` function defined in our C++ code. Shifting the entry point from this C function to a C++ function.

So now that we have the basic HAL setup for the GPIO pin we wish to toggle, we can create a higher level driver abstraction for controlling **ANY** LED pin.

## Creating an LED Blinker object in C++ üö¶

Let‚Äôs define a small abstraction to control an LED conveniently in C++: `LedBlinker.hpp` . Here we use the `.hpp` because this is C++ üòâ
```c++
#pragma once

#include "stm32wbxx_hal.h"

class LedBlinker {
public:
    LedBlinker(GPIO_TypeDef* port_ptr, uint16_t pin_num)
        : port(port_ptr), pin(pin_num) {}

    void on()  { HAL_GPIO_WritePin(port, pin, GPIO_PIN_SET); }
    void off() { HAL_GPIO_WritePin(port, pin, GPIO_PIN_RESET); }

private:
    GPIO_TypeDef* port;
    uint16_t pin;
};
```

## App Entry Point 

Now with the `LedBlinker` abstraction setup, we create the application header and implementation file.

The application's header file declares the new entry point function: `start()` for the final executable.
```c++
#pragma once

#ifdef __cplusplus
extern "C" {
#endif

void start(void);

#ifdef __cplusplus
}
#endif
```

and the implementation file uses the `LedBlinker` abstraction to blink the Blue LED on and off.

```c++
#include "app.hpp"
#include "LedBlinker.hpp"

extern "C" {
#include "main.h"
#include "stm32wbxx_hal.h"
}

void start() {

    LedBlinker led(GPIOB, GPIO_PIN_5); // Blue LED on Nucleo board

    
    while (1) { // infinite loop
        led.on();
        HAL_Delay(5000); // 5 seconds
        led.off();
        HAL_Delay(5000);
    }
}
```
Now that we've created this new logic for our application we will replace the generated main loop with a call to our application instead.

```c
#include "app.hpp" // include our new application header

int main(void)
{
  HAL_Init();
  SystemClock_Config();
  PeriphCommonClock_Config();
  MX_GPIO_Init(); 
  
  /* USER CODE BEGIN */

  start(); // New C++ entry point

  /* USER CODE END*/
}
```
Be sure to always keep C++ logic outside generated files or inside `/* USER CODE */` blocks. This helps keep your code from being touched by the generator.

## Update CMake file to Include Our C++ Code

Next we add the new source file to the build system by defining the source file location in our `CMakeLists.txt`:

```cmake
# Add C++ sources
target_sources(${CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME} PRIVATE
    ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/Core/app.cpp
)
```

## Building and Flashing the Project

Open up the terminal in VSCode and build the project with the following CMake commands:

```bash
$ cmake --preset Debug
$ cmake --build build/Debug
...
...
[23/23] Linking CXX executable Blinky.elf
Memory region         Used Size  Region Size  %age Used
           FLASH:       10380 B       512 KB      1.98%
            RAM1:        1584 B     196600 B      0.81%
      RAM_SHARED:          0 GB        10 KB      0.00%
```
Our final executable is now ready to be flashed on the device! 
## Flashing the Firmware üå©Ô∏è

Use STM32CubeProgrammer to flash the compiled binary.
Load the `.elf` file and download it to the board. Then reset the board with the onboard reset button.

If successful, you should see the blue LED blinking every 5 seconds!

## Conclusion üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

This hybrid approach combines the ease of STM32CubeMX peripheral configuration and HAL generation, with the power and modularity of modern C++ and CMake.

Our project setup allows for a clean, maintainable base for future embedded projects: 
- building BLE applications,
- sensor-driven systems, or 
- working with RTOS in the future.

This post took way longer than I wanted it to take and honestly I'm now thinking that if making a video tutorial would've been the better alternative hereüòÑ.. hahah 

Overall, this was a great learning experience and if I had a bit more patience I'd figure out how to flash onto the device using a command line script instead of using the CubeProgrammer tool üòÖ. 


I'd love to hear how you approach STM32 development.
Have you built a similar setup with C++ and CMake?
Do you prefer CubeIDE or else like Ozone? Drop your tips, tricks, or even rants below! üëá
