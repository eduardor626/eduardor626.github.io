## My Early Career

My first professional software engineering position was at an industrial automation startup in 2021. It was fast paced, challenging, and most importantly very impactful in my development as an engineer.

### Valuable Outcomes

- It was the first time I applied real world mathematics, specifically Linear Algebra. This forced me to touch up on basic physics, unit conversion, data analysis, and other math topics to understand the algorithms being implemented or the data being processed.

  - Experienced higher level math and its use in the real world!

- The project itself was exciting to work on. We were implementing point cloud processing algorithms on data being acquired by various sensors. This data was then used to automate industrial machinery.
  - I  was able to develop C++ code for each part of the application pipeline (application, sensor integration, processing algorithms, gui, build system).

- My knowledge of modern C++(14/17/20) grew substantially. Prior to this job I had no practice with any new features of the standard past C++11.

### The Layoff 

Early 2024 I was laid off due to an unstable Chinese economy and a company reorganization. Looking back, I took the layoff really well. I saw it as an opportunity to push and prove to myself that I could land another job.

Sort of like a **capability test**. Could I get another software engineering job or was I just lucky this past time?

Of course I had doubts and imagined the worst scenarios. But I didn’t let up. I added new daily tasks in order to improve my chances of passing traditional interviews. 
- Solved Leetcode problems daily
- Restudied data structures and algorithms topics
- Spam applied on LinkedIn and Indeed, interacted with various recruiters.

And within a month, I landed another job.

## Intro to Embedded Systems with C

This time, I landed a more embedded-focused role, working on updating Board Support Packages and writing test applications for hardware drivers.

This was a slight shift in syntax, as I had to refer back to C style syntax instead of the usual C++ that I was so used to. Both languages share many common similarities so I was able to transition really quickly.


### Valuable Outcomes

- The knowledge of CMake files and the build system from my previous role really helped me shine here. 
  - I was able to speed up build processes and separate components in an organized fashion.
- Learned about toolchain files when compiling code for specific target architectures.
- Introduction to an embedded systems software engineering role. 
  - Knowing the difference between application level software and embedded level software.
- Greater confidence in my ability to adapt and survive in a new work environment


### Did Not Pass Vibe Check

But...

- The day to day was way too slow and the company culture seemed hostile.
- The company was unstable as layoffs were happening a few months into my position and tension in the building rose amongst employees. Everyone felt that they were next on the chopping block.
- I didn’t see growth at the rate at which I would've been happy with here as well. There were tons of project delays and a very slow project development cycle. Coming from a fast-paced startup this was a huge difference.


So... I decided to jump ship after about 10 months at the end of 2024. 

This proved to be one of the best decisions of my career.


## A Fresh Start

At the start of 2025 I received the opportunity to work for a new company, much closer to home with a promising leader. I took on a new embedded software role working on measurement devices and process automation.

This is now my **third job since graduating**. I believe I have passed my self imposed **capability test**! Ha



### Valuable Outcomes So Far
- Great work environment and group of people to work with, along with exciting projects to work on. Not updating or sustaining legacy code but building new applications which I truly enjoy.
- I feel a lot more confident in my programming abilities, algorithmic thinking, and ability to develop solutions and solve problems on my own. I serve as a mentor to a newer developer which has contributed greatly to my development as a leader.
- Developing a deeper understanding of embedded systems and the tools associated with debugging software for them.
  - Debuggers, Logic Analyzers, Power Supplies, GPIOs, etc.
- Writing **space-optimal** and **time-restrictive** code due to limited constraints
- Created the architecture for the test framework used in the hardware-in-the-loop (HITL) testing using Python.
- Using C++20 and newer features of the standard.


## Looking Ahead

My career feels like its only starting off but I'm excited in seeing the direction its headed. I'm thinking about learning Rust in the future to really equip myself with valuable tools needed in the embedded realm. Rust seems to be gaining a lot of popularity so it seems worth looking into.

I'm excited to see what my future looks like here and am grateful for the growth thats accumulated through my previous experiences.
