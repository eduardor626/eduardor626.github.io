# Introduction üß†üíµ

**The Psychology of Money** explores how behavior and psychology, rather than just technical knowledge, play a crucial role in financial success.

Through real-world examples, the book challenges conventional knowledge about wealth by showing how factors like personal experience, luck, risk tolerance, and disciplined saving habits can shape our financial outcomes.

# Personal Experience Shapes Financial Decisions

Housel describes how our unique life experiences shape our approach to money. 

He mentions an example by explaining why economically disadvantaged individuals often view lottery tickets as a rational escape route despite living paycheck to paycheck. Their perspective on risk and reward, he argues, differs from those born into wealth. And although it may seem crazy to do so, it actually isn't that crazy when you start to break down the situation.

The impact of personal choices versus what you do for a living is also something he brings up throughout the book. He talks about a janitor who quietly amassed $8 million by his death, and a high-powered executive who, despite his prestigious position and flashy displays of wealth, ultimately filed for bankruptcy. This financial outcome defies traditional societal expectations and showed the importance of financial literacy.


# Luck üçÄ and Risk üé≤

Outcomes in life are often a result of both luck and risk. Housel explains that this is not only true in our lives but also in financial success.

An example of this is Bill Gates‚Äô story. His early access to a computer in high schoo (a rare privilege at the time) allowed him to develop programming skills way before other students in the U.S, significantly influencing his future success.

Housel emphasizes that financial outcomes aren't solely determined by individual effort or talent, but are also shaped by circumstances beyond our control. 

This is seen in both positive and negative ways: some find themselves benefiting from good timing or unexpected opportunities, while others deal with setbacks despite their best efforts.

Throughout our lives, we must deal with this risk and play the cards that we are dealt in the best way possible. There's luck, risk, and favorable or disfavorable outcomes that we encounter each and every day. 

  I really enjoyed this section and made a mental note to have the wisdom to recognize and benefit from fortunate situations while trying to build resilience against unfavorable ones. All while remaining grateful for both outcomes. 


# The Pursuit of Enough üôÇ

Housel talks about knowing how much ‚Äúenough‚Äù is, and how it is key to financial success. Everyone's definition of "enough" is different but the man who is able to have a basic definition for it will always be rich. He who is satisfied with less will always have more. 

*"The hardest financial skill is getting the goalpost to stop moving."*

Social comparison and never feeling satisfied can prevent us from true wealth and happiness. 

Knowing when you have enough allows you to avoid unecessary risks like purchasing that new car, toy, or material that you don't really need. To me, this relates to delaying gratification for a much more purposeful long-term goal.

# Getting Wealthy üíµ vs. Staying Wealthy üí∏

Different strategies are needed to acquire wealth versus maintaining it. He encourages us to continue to reflect on the importance of humility, flexibility, and planning for the long-term to ensure financial security over time. 

Often times, we create our lifestyle based on our income. We make more, we spend more. This can lead us in a revolving door where we stay broke because we spend according to our new means of life.

Often times we think , "I just want to be rich". But is that really  the end goal? What happens when we get rich, is the game over? 

No. We must maintain the wealth! Once we're at the top, we can only go down.

I like to think of this with a gym analogy. Often times we talk about how much we want to be "jacked". But what happens when we achieve that dream physique through hard work and proper nutrition. Do we simply stop working out and go back to eating junk food? No, we must maintain the physique by continuing to do the things that got us there! Continuing to learn, adapt, and stay hungry.

# The Role of Failure in Financial Success ü•≤

We underestimate how normal it is for a lot of things to fail. Which causes us to overreact when they do. As kids we're often scolded for failure and so this makes us anxious, scared, and fearful of failure. 

In most fields we only see the finished product, not the losses incurred that led to the final successful product.

Acknowledging that failure is a part of success can help individuals build a more resilient financial strategy, avoiding overreaction to setbacks. This also relates to life in general. Things don't always go according to plan and we must be okay with this. 

*"You plan , god laughs. üôÉ"*

I know I personally have trouble with this and tend to try to micro-manage every aspect of my finances at times. But inevitably, things happen, a detour gets thrown in my path, an unexpected bill or situation occurs, and I must adapt. Without being too hard on myself or creating more stress than necessary. 

Success is never linear. Only in the movies haha

# Freedom and Time ‚åö

Housel talks about how time and control over it are essential components of happiness. 

*"Time and being in control of it is the biggest variable to happiness."*

I totally agree with this statement. I find myself being extremely content with my life when I am in control of what I get to do and when I get to do it.

Money plays a role here because it can provide that time and freedom. An example of this is having enough saved to know if you don‚Äôt like a certain job you can easily take time off without it hurting you financially to look for a new one. 


# The Importance of Saving üí∞

Saving without a specific goal is key to long-term freedom.

Saving without thinking about how you will spend it allows you to have flexibility in case of emergencies or opportunities. I really like how Housel brought up thinking about this fund as an **Opportunity Fund**, as opposed to an emergency fund. Having a financial cushion for future opportunities sounds way more appealing than saving for something unfortunate to happen. 

Not to say that something negative won't happen, but the perspective of having the opportunity to be financially secure to handle it is what I am tryijng to get at here.

Saving as a foundation for wealth and having financial security offers peace of mind. It allows us to sleep better at night knowing that we will be okay. 

# Managing Your Financial Game üí≤üéÆ

Don‚Äôt pay attention to other people‚Äôs decisions on money and you are in no danger of being persuaded by them. Define the financial game that you're playing.

 Being tricked by people playing a different game can also throw off how we think we‚Äôre supposed to spend our money. So much consumer spending is socially driven. I definitley see this especially in this modern world of social media, where the most extravagent posts get the most attention and appeal.

It's important to understand our own financial goals and to resist the temptation to follow the financial paths of others who may have different priorities or circumstances than ourselves.

# The Role of Humility and Ego ü´≥üèº

Being rich and being wealthy is different. Wealth is not seen. This is why it‚Äôs so hard to find wealthy role models Housel states. 

They are lowkey. We only see the rich and social media personalities and aspire to be like these people but these people are often the least financially stable.

Manage your money in a way that helps you sleep at night. Be nicer and less flashy. No one is impressed with your possessions as much as you are 
 

# Conclusion üëçüèº

Morgan Housell provides valuable information on the impacts of our psychology to our financial outcomes. The topics of luck, risk, humility, adaptability, discipline, and logical planning all play as variables in both our financial and personal success. 

This is a great read that I highly recommend to anyone wanting to further investigate the relationship with themselves and realize how much they truly are in charge of their financial success based on our personal choices! It provides the reader with reflection and analyzing their own upbringing and realizing that they can take something from the experiences discussed in this book and apply it to their own lives.

those looking for a deeper understanding of money, individuals seeking financial independence, or anyone interested in the psychology behind financial decisions

The book made me reflect on how little financial literacy is often taught to us and how we must take ownership of our education and investing time to learn more about it. 

I really enjoyed his idea of having the Opportunity Fund as opposed to the Emergency Fund. Its a more positive way to look at a savings versus saving for something to go wrong.


Go out of your way to find humility when things are going right and forgiveness / compassion when they go wrong 

and his perspective on events not going as planned but having forgiveness and compassion for ourselves when they do.
