## The Journey So Far

A reflection on my career growth since my first software engineering role. What I’ve learned through a layoff, new roles, continued practice, and where I want to go next.

---

## My Early Career

Early 2024 I was laid off from my software engineering position at a Chinese industrial automation company. It was my first "real" job as a software engineer—and the place where I picked up on Modern C++.

### What I learned:
- Lambdas
- `constexpr` vs. `const`
- Smart pointers
- Move constructors
- CMake and the build system
- Git and submodules
- Template metaprogramming
- Unit testing
- Software architecture
- A whole set of tools used in C++ development

## The Layoff!

Looking back, I took the layoff really well. I saw it as an opportunity to push myself and prove that I could land another job.

Kind of like a **capability test**. Could I do it again?

Of course, I had doubts and imagined the worst scenarios. But I didn’t let up—I stayed on the grind:

- Solved Leetcode problems daily
- Restudied data structures and algorithms

And within a month, I landed another job.

## Intro to Embedded Systems with C

This time, I landed a more embedded-focused role, working on:

- Updating Board Support Packages (BSPs)
- Writing test applications for Linux hardware drivers

Most of the codebase was in C, but I got to write test apps in C++14/17 to verify driver functionality.

### What I learned:

- Linux OS internals
- Bootloaders and drivers
- The importance of toolchain files when building for specific targets

It was also my **highest-paid gig at the time**, and that felt great. I had another engineering job under my belt.

But...

- The work was *pretty boring*
- The company was unstable as layoffs were happening and hostility was rising.
- I didn’t see growth at the rate at which I would've been happy with.

So... I decided to jump ship after about 10 months, and I’m glad I did.

## A Fresh Start

Earlier this year I transitioned into a new embedded role, much closer to home. This is now my **third job since graduating**.

I feel a lot more confident in my ability to get software engineering jobs. I’ve landed two and reached final interviews multiple times within the past year.

### What I’ve learned in the past six months:

- Continuous Integration pipelines
- Hardware-in-the-loop (HITL) testing
- Better software architecture patterns
- Writing **space-optimal** and **time-restrictive** code
- A deeper understanding of the build process
- Using **debuggers**!!!

## Looking Ahead

This journey feels like it’s just starting.

I feel confident in my current C/C++ skillset, but to truly become a **fully stacked embedded engineer**, I think the next step is picking up **Rust**.

That would complete a pretty skillful "build" for my engineering toolkit.

I’m excited to see what new opportunities come next.
