## Career Growth

Early 2024 I was laid off of my softare engineering position at a Chinese industrial automation company. It was my first 'real' job as a software engineer and where I really picked up on Modern C++. 

Lambdas, what the difference between `constexpr` vs. `const` was, smart pointers, move constructors, CMake, the build system, submodules, git, template metaprogramming, unit testing, software architecture, and a whole set of common tools and topics used in C++ project development were few of many new concepts I learned throughout my time here. 

Thinking about the layoff now, I took it really well. I saw it as an opportunity to push myself to get another job. To really prove to myself more than anyone else that I could land another job. Sort of like a capability test, proving to myself that I AM a capable software engineer. 

Of course I had huge doubts at times and thought of the worst scenarios. But I didn't let up and continued the grind. I also started to grind out leetcode daily and self-studied data structures again on the side. 

Within a month I was able to land another job. This time, it was more embedded focused working on updating board support packages and writing test applications for drivers. The code of course was dominantly written in C. 

However, I was able to write the test applications using C++14/17 to test the  Linux hardware drivers of the board and verify their intended functionalities.

This experience was interesting. At the time it was my highest paid gig and it felt good having another engineering job under my belt. On a positive note, I was still working on C/C++, learning about bootloaders, drivers, the Linux OS,  and the significance of toolchain files for building for specific target operating systems.

On the other hand... it was pretty boring and I did not see any career growth for myself there due to company instability . I decided to jump ship around 10 months into the position and I'm glad I did. 

Earlier this year I transitioned into an embedded role closer to home. This is my third software engineering job since I graduated from university. I definitely feel more confident in my ability to get jobs as I've been able to land two and receive interviews and final interviews within the past year. 

These past six months have been some of the best in my career so far. I've learned so much more about myself, software architecture, best practices, continuous integration, hardware in the loop tests, writing space optimal and time restrictive code, the build process more in depth, using Debuggers!!! HOW THE HELL HAVE I NEVER USED A DEBUGGER!!! >.<  (More on this in a later post)

The journey has just started for me, but I'm excited to see the future opportunities that come through my path. I feel I have a good hold on C/C++, but in order to be a fully stacked embedded software engineer, I feel as if I should also learn Rust. This would complete a pretty skillful 'build' in my software engineerings skills.
